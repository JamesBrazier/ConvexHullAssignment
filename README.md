# ConvexHullAssignment
An assignment I did for a algorithms course of the performance of convex hull algorithms

This was an assignment for a second year algorithms course that required me to implement three types of convex hull algorithms
and test the speed of them to each other in python. Along with the giftwrap and Graham scan algorithms, I also looked at the quick
hull algorithm. I have included the report and data in the respository.
